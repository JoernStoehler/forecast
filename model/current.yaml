justifications:
  J1: "Compute enables capability; governance can cap effective compute."
  J2: "Algorithmic efficiency gains substitute for compute growth."
  J3: "Policy can constrain access to top-tier hardware/runs."
  J4: "Risk incentives and capability drive high-stakes deployment."
  J5: "Higher capability/deployment â†’ more severe incidents per unit time."
  J6: "Better evals reduce deceptive alignment prevalence detected before deployment."
  J7: "At higher capability, deception becomes easier/more instrumentally useful."
  J8: "Either prevalent deception or severe incidents can precipitate loss-of-control."
  J9: "Incidents move public salience, which drives governance stringency (lagged)."
  J10: "Emergency levers (audit, shutdown, rollback) reduce realized catastrophe."
